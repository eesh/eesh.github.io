      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <span>My name is Eesh Chilukalapalli and I'm a programmer and a creator. I am super passionate about making software because it is soooooo easy to give life to the ideas that pop up inside of my head. It is also amazing how even a small piece of software can be an important part of someone's life!</span>
      <br /> <br />
      <span>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in software engineering at SRM University, Chennai. So far the journey has been great and I've learnt a lot of valuable lessons. Once I graduate, I wish to pursue a Master's degree in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I love helping people and one day I wish to create a large-scale product that will become an integral part of people's lives (for the better). I also love tinkering with robots and I think they have a lot of potential. A small set of emotions can make them feel a lot more personal than they are right now.</span>
      <br /> <br />
      <span>My hobbies include motorcycling, photography, and music. I love photography for the same reason I love making software. Just like how software allows me to materialize the ideas I get in my head, a camera allows me to capture the scenes that I picture in my head. I play the guitar and I'm currently learning how to play the piano. The only piece I can play right now is 'River flow in you' by Yiruma. I find that piece extremely soothing and always listen to it with my eyes closed. I also sing from time to time but until I can make the recordings sound professional I'm not going to go into details :D</span>
